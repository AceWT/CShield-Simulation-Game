There was leakage in cooling agent which triggered one of generators to catch fire.
Fire spread to one of labs and level 2 and LS-457 went airborne!! S.A.I.N.T initiated automatic lockdown I can't override it from my station and I can't go anywhere
since bridge control guys aren't responding--

I turned off firewall to remote Console, hopefully you can restart MAINFRAME after purge period just in case I won't be able to.. If you at Base are reading this here is current
system status:

MAINFRAME - shut itself off
SAINT - off
Sections 1-17 down - no power
We are on backup generators only
